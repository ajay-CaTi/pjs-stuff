# Object oriented programming (oop)

- Style of programming where a program as a collection of object that talk to each other to perform some functionality.

- if a function part of an object it is called a method

# Hoisting

When JS engine executes code it moves all functionn declaration at the top

Hoisting is movie function declaration at the top

# Iterator

Plain Objects created with object literal syntax do not have iterator

but some have Symbol.iterator i.e they are iterable

discount, ...prices after rest there is no another parameter exist

# error

When an error is thrown next line is not executed jump out from method at catch block

window object BECAUSE method have another callback function that reference this to global object
